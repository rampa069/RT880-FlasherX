*chmod +x RT880-FlasherX*

You need to also give yourself access to serial ports, on Linux this is by adding yourself to the 'dialout' group  
*sudo usermod -a -G dialout your_username*
  
On macOS, you may need to remove the quarantine attribute from the downloaded app bundle:  
*sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine RT880-FlasherX.app*
