# RT880-FlasherX
A (hopefully) cross platform .bin firmware flasher for the Radtel RT-880 and iRadio UV-98
There's a whole bunch of platforms in releases. Download the one for your system and run the "RT880-FlasherX" executable inside.

You need to make the program file executable (by adding the +x file permission)  
*chmod +x RT880-FlasherX*

You need to also give yourself access to serial ports, on Linux this is by adding yourself to the 'dialout' group  
*sudo usermod -a -G dialout your_username*
  
On OSX I have no idea, I do not have Mac and never will.
